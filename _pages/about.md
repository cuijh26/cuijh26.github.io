I am currently a senior undergraduate student in the [School of Software Engineering](https://sse.sysu.edu.cn/) at Sun Yat-sen University, and I will be joining the [AI3 Institute](https://ai3.fudan.edu.cn/) of Fudan University in the fall of 2025 to pursue my Ph.D. My research interests include audio-driven talking head generation, as well as controllable and personalized video generation.
